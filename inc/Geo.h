 | Integer math allow for a greater control of rounding behaviour.
 | You have to be very careful of the range of intermediate results.
 |  Intermediate results are often in their own ballpark when it 
 | comes to range. When storing and using them, you should always take 
 | that into account. For instance: 
 |   * Square norm of a vector will usually have a meaningful range in 
 | the 0..62 bits range (depending on the vector) and therefore should 
 | probably stored on a long long or a float. Depending on your 
 | problem, you might want to keep the norm of a vector, alongside 
 | its coordinates, instead of the square norm, because the norm will
 | usually be more comparable to the coordinates and therefore hold 
 | better information/bit.
 |   * Ratios will usually hold a meaningful rational part as well
 | as a scale factor. So, you will usually want to keep them in 
 | a fixed point integer, alongside an exponant factor, or both of
 | those options (aka, float).
 |   * In our case: quaternion will usually be used as unitary 
 | quaternions and might better be used as 7:24 fixed integers. Using
 | an exponent in this case is not useful.

 | Neighbourhood:
 |    Usage: insert your objects into the neighbourhood. You might
 | then be able to use the "for each interact" method, which will list
 | the pair of objects likely to intersect each other.
 |    The neighbourhood constructs a 3d map of the objects location and
 | rules out some of the possible interactions based on it. Depending 
 | on your problem, it can be quite a lot.
 |    That method fits mainly with problems where objects can only 
 | slightly overlap. Typically this is the case with solid objects
 | that aren't too "empty".
 |    In that case, we can expect the neighbourhood to be constructed
 | in a NLog(s) operations, and the listing in about mN operations. 
 | Where s is the volume of the occupied space compared to the volume 
 | of the smallest object, and m is a constant that represent the
 | number of neighbours of the same size an object can typically have.
 |    The memory taken by the neighbourhood is in NLog(s).
 |    Object relocation is possible. But the constant s will typically
 | only grow, which means you should only do this if you're going to 
 | stay in the same overall location. Usually, if the number of still
 | objects is not much greater than the number of moving objects, it
 | might be faster to construct the neighbourhood, use it a few times
 | and then dispose of it and build a new one.

 | Bounding spheres are defined with a point and a radius. You can use any

 | means cubic spheres with a radius equal to the radius given and sides 
 | parallel to the axes. You should make sure that your spheres fit into 
 | those, depending on your distance, you might have to adjust your radius
